                    <p>Our interactions with other humans today are increasingly becoming mediated through technology, a trend that this pandemic has only exacerbated. Meanwhile, a plethora of computational systems have been introduced in the last several decades that have us interacting with each other in different ways. Sometimes the outcome is good for people and society, leading to serendipitous exchange, collaborative learning, civic engagement, large-scale open and public projects, creative cultural production, and the strengthening of social bonds and support networks. However, we are now more and more attuned to the negative ramifications of these systems, including rampant harassment, polarization and strife, surveillance and loss of rights, trolling and grifting, information overload, misinformation, and the spread of hate.</p>
                    <p>As designers and builders of social computing systems, can we imagine a better future? How do we know whether our imagined designs will encourage pro-social outcomes, and how do we guard against harmful negative consequences? How do we know whether a system will be effective or even adopted in the first place?</p>

                  This course welcomes all students of all backgrounds. The
                  computer science and computer engineering industries have

                  sufficient past efforts by the field toward even greater
                  diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Allen School seeks to
                  create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment

                  to be treated by your classmates and myself with respect. If
                  any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a

                      Each class will feature 2-3 papers around a common theme
                      in social computing system design. I aimed to pick papers
                      that have a mix of methods, a mix of contributions,
                      including more theoretical versus more artifact
                      contributions, and a mix of older and more recent work. In
                      some classes, you will get choose which among a set of
                      papers to read. This often happened because I had trouble
                      picking among a number of important papers, so you are of
                      course welcome to read all of them.

                      annotations posted by 8PM the night before class so that
                      the discussion leaders can prepare their presentation for
                      class. I will be distributing PDFs of the papers on the NB
                      platform, which allows for inline annotation to support
                      threaded comments in the margins of the text. You will be
                      expected to contribute at least one comment or reply to a
                      comment on each of your papers. I encourage you to use
                      this platform to leave more targeted and off-the-cuff
                      thoughts and questions while you are in the process of
                      reading and to read and respond to the comments left
                      behind by other students.

                      At the conclusion of reading, you will be required to post a 1-paragraph reflection on each of the papers you read to our Canvas discussion board. This too needs to be done by 8PM the night before class to give discussion leaders time to work on their presentation for class. In each 1-paragraph reflection, you should provide your thoughts on what you found interesting about the work, questions that the work raised, connections to other literature or research fields, a reflection of how the work relates to your own projects or prior personal experience, and/or reflect on how the work relates to anything happening in current events. In your responses, you can also connect one reading to another one of the readings or even respond to another student's response.

                      For about two of the classes, you'll be part of a pair tasked with leading the class discussion on the readings. When you are a discussion leader, you do not need to write reading responses, though you may find it useful to do anyway (you should still annotate the readings). At the beginning of the class, you should give a 5-10 minute presentation covering the background on the topic of the class, the content of the papers, and how they sit in dialogue with each other. You'll provide your personal take on these papers, including where you think the work could be improved or extended. For more historical papers, you'll consider how well they hold up today and reframe them given the current state of social technology.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You will then lead a ~30 minute discussion with the class. You'll summarize students' reading responses, pulling out the patterns that you noticed or the reflections you found particularly interesting. Start us off with at least 3 questions or points of discussion drawing from students' responses to spur in-class discussion among students. Feel free to devise interesting ways to engage students, such as coming up with an activity, think-pair-shares, or play with different social technologies to elicit different types of engagement (very relevant to the class!).

                  In this assignment, your goal is to reflect on your personal
                  usage of social technology to share with the class. You can
                  approach this project a number of ways. Feel free to be
                  creative! For example you could take a data-driven approach to
                  track or measure some aspect of your online social experience
                  for a week. You could do a retrospective analysis of your own
                  activity on social media, email, or some other social
                  technology or that of a community that you are active in over
                  a longer period of time. You could spend a week attempting to
                  change some aspect of your social technology usage, such as
                  switching to a new technology or contributing in a different
                  way, and report back on the experience. You could interview or
                  survey a moderator or community member of a community that you
                  are active in. The output of your work can be in any format
                  but should be accompanied by a write-up of no more than 1 page
                  (not counting visual aids) that will be posted as a blog post.

                    Your goal for this assignment is to report on an interesting, niche, or unusual online community. You can be a part of this community or it can be a community that you find online. It can even be a community that you were once a part of but left or is now no longer active. Do not share any personal or private information about community members, and be respectful of community boundaries. What is interesting or unique about this community? What sorts of social technology do they use to interact and what are some important features of their systems? Are the dynamics in the community pro-social or anti-social? What are the norms, and are they clear or opaque? How does the community treat newcomers? How do people self-identify? What is the governance of the community and how do people gain influence or power? Is there anything that happened in this community's past that impacted how it is now? Feel free to use any method to answer any of these questions. You don't have to answer all of these questions but tell us the parts you find most interesting. You will write this up in a document that is no more than 1 page (not counting visual aids) and that will be posted as a blog post.

                    Take an existing social technology, come to an understanding of how it works, and then critique its design along the lines of the topics that we have discussed so far. For instance, how well does the design help to guard against harassment or other forms of unwanted behavior? How is power and work explicitly distributed among users of the technology via the code? What parts of the system are customizable? What happens to any data and who has access to it? Is there any automation that happens within the system and how malleable or transparent is it? How does the design address newcomers, or members operating at a distance, or people's self-expression and identity? These are just ideas---please try to pick just one or two main aspects to guide your critique. You will write this up in a document that is no more than 1 page (not counting visual aids) and that will be posted as a blog post.

                    For your final assignment, you will reflect on the state of the field of social computing given the readings and topics covered in the class. What do you think are the most exciting avenues for future research? Are there topics that you feel have not received enough attention or that deserve renewed attention for some reason? Are there historical trends that you notice or outside influences that you think have shaped the field? Are there methods you think should be used more? Are there other disciplines that social computing systems researchers should engage with more? How should the field think about public impact and public outreach and engagement? These are just ideas to spur your thoughts---please just focus on one or a few topics at most. You will write this up in a document that is no more than 1 page (not counting visual aids) and that will be posted as a blog post.

                  In a quarter-long team or individual project, you'll conduct a
                  research project that furthers our understanding of social
                  computing system design. You are not expected to produce
                  publishable work in the course of this quarter; however, the
                  work should tackle an interesting research question that could
                  be expanded to become publishable work after the quarter is
                  over. If you have an ongoing research project that might
                  relate to the topics in this course, connecting to your
                  research is encouraged.

                      Why is designing social technologies so hard? While code
                      and databases can be rigid and brittle, as social actors,
                      we have nuanced social requirements and perform actions
                      circumstantially. There is an inherent gap here that may
                      be unbridgeable. But trying to just directly replicate
                      in-person interaction also misses out on new possibilities
                      with technology. Instead, in building a constructed world,
                      what we are creating are new interactions---these are
                      different from offline social requirements but equally
                      rich.

                      One major difficulty with making progress in social computing systems research is how to do evaluation. It is valuable to know if people will use a new design and how they would use it in a realistic setting. However, recruitment, medium-to-long-term usage, and eventual adoption can be difficult to achieve.

                      Building on last week's readings, we dive deeper into the tradeoffs and opportunities for design in between greater flexibility versus more formalized structure in technology-mediated social interaction. This tension comes up repeatedly in social activities such as coordination, preference elicitation, and communication. Requirements are also different depending on who is being coordinated and what they are coordinating on. Finally, what gets captured vs not in the structure has political ramifications.

                      As Suchman pointed out, design decisions in social computing systems can reinforce or reconfigure power. What work becomes visible or invisible as a result of the design? Who (or what) gets delegated new responsibilities? And who benefits from that additional work or that delegation? Particularly in the workplace, where there is usually already an existing power hierarchy, answers to these questions can impact adoption.

                      Though technology enables collaboration across distances, it is still difficult, as we have experienced to some degree in this pandemic year of collaborating remotely. There are also different kinds of distances---it can mean distance across space and time-zones, across time (synchronous vs asynchronous), and across cultures and contexts. Can design of social systems account for these distances or mitigate the struggles of working across them?

                      Social translucence is about designing what social information we make visible to others, what information has central vs peripheral awareness, and what we become accountable for as a result (I know that you know that I know...) This visibility can be negotiated, sometimes even with technology itself as justification. Finally, configuring what is "shared" changes when moving from a centralized space for social activity to a networked or personally filtered one.

                      An important aspect of social computing system design is designing capabilities for identity expression and management. In time, we've gone from visions of a "identity-less utopia" in the days of the early internet to more recently, Facebook's "Real Name" policy. So should systems enforce any aspect of identity? What meta-data can an individual associate with an account, what aspects are salient in presentation to different audiences, and how expressive, flexible, and controllable is that presentation? How much can we be authentically and fluidly ourselves given certain technical designs?

                      Social technologies today make design decisons and provide tools that shape individuals' self-expression or self-presentation, either on their behalf or with their control. They also regulate what kinds of self-expression are not permitted. Once deployed on a platform and widely adopted, such digitally-mediated self-expression can result in feedback loops that alter community norms or even societal expectations.

                      As the amount of social content increases, the curation of that content for individuals burdened with information overload becomes paramount. There are many ways to reduce this burden. Senders could be more selective about whom they send to. Receivers could configure what they want to receive. Groups of people could collectively decide what is desired versus not. Because this can be burdensome too, algorithms could try to learn these things to do them on behalf of people. That last strategy is common now on many platforms but introduces new problems.

                      Instead of builders imposing designs on users, what would it mean to design so that user agency and consent comes first? Instead of designers encoding a singular way of communicating into technology, what if social systems allowed for people and groups to come up with their own designs and tailor it to their needs? How much is this feasible for users to do on their own vs by communicating their requirements to members of their community with programming skills?

                      One of the first problems for any online social space is getting it off the ground. Even when a community is established, it is still important to invite and bring in new members or else the community may stagnate and eventually become like a "ghost town". How can social computing systems be designed to motivate or incentivize contribution?

                      In every social setting, there are norms about what is acceptable behavior. In a highly homogeneous and exclusive setting, norms may not need to be spoken. But in open, diverse, and more inclusive settings, norms need to be visible and regularly and transparently enacted in order to be broadly known and followed. The work of cultivating norms in an online social space involves both design of tools as well as the human labor of community leaders.

                      Even in the days of MUDs, USENET newsgroups, and mailing lists, all the way to today, online social systems have had to contend with anti-social, disruptive, and harassing behavior within their communities. What should be done when someone violates the rules or norms in an online social setting? How should a community address interpersonal conflicts that arise?

                      Zooming out from the design of how to enforce or notify about rules is the broader question of how rules get made and who has the power to participate in rule-making---questions of governance. While some social technologies have encoded alternative governance structures, the majority of online social systems have some sort of autocratic or technocratic structure with designated roles for administrators and moderators and over the long term, ossified leadership, as opposed to democracy.

                      The design of policy and technology goes hand in hand to affect use. Today, we live in a world of "platform-ized" social spaces online, with a handfull of private companies that each have massive user populations. In this environment, the governance of and governance by these platforms have huge ramifications for society and public discourse. What could we change about policy or about technology to make platforms more accountable to society?

                      Hallin's spheres and the Overton window are both theories to describe a range of public consensus on political topics. As more people move online and into large, public platforms where everyone has the capability to command a megaphone and find like-minded people, some of these people will seek to use that power to push an agenda. When that agenda is to spread disinformation or further polarization and mistrust, is there anything we can do counter that with design?

                      Despite threats to democracy posed by social technologies, these spaces can also be an exciting avenue to further collective and civic action in a democratic society. Social technologies can enable grassroots political movements to grow that push for cultural and political change and also involve more people in the process of governing by inviting greater public input and deliberation. Many social technologies used for these purposes weren't built with them in mind. Could they better support these goals?

                      All these opportunities for greater participation enabled by social technologies in principle help to shift the power balance from implementors, governors, and designers towards the people who are actually affected by the decisions that people in power make. However in practice, sometimes "participation-washing" can be extractive and disempowering. Other times, a great deal of participation results in no outcome. How can design of social technologies support not just the elicitation of opinions and dialogue but also the converging of a group of people towards consensus, solution, or action?
