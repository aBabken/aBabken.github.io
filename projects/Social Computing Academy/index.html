Finally, all students individually or in groups will conduct a research project on building, evaluating, or theorizing about a new social computing design.

                  This course welcomes all students of all backgrounds. The computer science and computer engineering industries have significant lack of diversity. This is due to a lack of sufficient past efforts by the field toward even greater diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Allen School seeks to create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for our community and our field. You should expect and demand to be treated by your classmates and myself with respect. If any incident occurs that challenges this commitment to a supportive, diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment, please let me know so the issue can be addressed.

                  <p>In this assignment, your goal is to reflect on your personal usage of social technology to share with the class. You can approach this project a number of ways. Feel free to be creative! For example you could take a data-driven approach to track or measure some aspect of your online social experience for a week. You could do a retrospective analysis of your own activity on social media, email, or some other social technology or that of a community that you are active in over a longer period of time. You could spend a week attempting to change some aspect of your social technology usage, such as switching to a new technology or contributing in a different way, and report back on the experience. You could interview or survey a moderator or community member of a community that you are active in. The output of your work can be in any format but should be accompanied by a write-up of no more than 1 page (not counting visual aids) that will be posted as a blog post.</p>

                    <p>Why is designing social technologies so hard? While code and databases can be rigid and brittle, as social actors, we have nuanced social requirements and perform actions circumstantially. There is an inherent gap here that may be unbridgeable. But trying to just directly replicate in-person interaction also misses out on new possibilities with technology. Instead, in building a constructed world, what we are creating are new interactions---these are different from offline social requirements but equally rich.</p>

While code and databases can be rigid and brittle, as social actors, we have nuanced social requirements and perform actions circumstantially. There is an inherent gap here that may be unbridgeable. But trying to just directly replicate in-person interaction also misses out on new possibilities with technology. Instead, in building a constructed world, what we are creating are new interactions---these are different from offline social requirements but equally rich.</p>
